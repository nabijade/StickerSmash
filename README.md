#StickerSmash App
- Expo and React Native tutorial
- Experimented with new programming language, JavaScript
- Learned basics of creating an app prototype through frontend development
- Some challenges were minute errors such as forgetting to import a React Native package into App.js and placing containers like in the right spots so the website version of the app actually appears
- With more time, I would have created a golf app tracking the user/player's score and calculate an average
- Unfortuanetely, the tutorial and program was time-consuming
- but with regard to StickerSmash I would add...
- multiple tabs to differentiate the user experience, as if it were a real app, and add an infinite amount of emojis (as is in Android and IOS) to add and scale to any desired size
- Additionally I would make it so the sticker/emoji's movement is limited to the picture
